Step 1:
Compile this elfloader like every other example with "build.py".
Step 2:
Go into a elfexamples folder and compile that with "make".
Step 3:
Copy the resulting boot.elf into the www/elfloader folder.
You can rename the elfloader folder to whatever you want
on your webserver, it'll automatically generate the address.
